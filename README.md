# Building_a_chatbot_in_Python
This project implements a chatbot in Python using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot uses a TF-IDF-based approach to generate responses by matching user queries with sentences from a trained corpus. It provides a basic conversational interface and can be extended with domain-specific data.
