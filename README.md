# Python Chatbot Project

This project implements a basic chatbot using Python. It uses text processing techniques, including tokenization and TF-IDF-based cosine similarity, to generate responses.

## Features
- Responds to user inputs using a trained corpus of text.
- Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK.
- Simple greeting and farewell protocol for user interaction.

## How It Works
1. The chatbot reads a text corpus (`chatbot.txt`) to train itself on example sentences and vocabulary.
2. User inputs are tokenized and preprocessed to remove punctuation and lemmatize words.
3. Using cosine similarity, the chatbot finds the most relevant response from the corpus.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:\n
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:\n
    ```bash
    cd chatbot_project
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:\n
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Ensure the `chatbot.txt` file (training corpus) is present in the directory.

5. Run the chatbot notebook (`chatbot.ipynb`) or script using a Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE.

## Training Corpus
The chatbot uses a training file named `chatbot.txt`. You can customize this file by adding any text data you'd like the chatbot to learn from.

**Example Corpus:**\n
The file can contain detailed information about any domain (e.g., Artificial Intelligence) to provide context-specific responses.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## How to Use\n
- Start the chatbot by running the script or notebook.
- Type a message in the input prompt to chat with the bot.
- To exit the conversation, type `Bye`.

## Example Interaction
```plaintext
BOT: My name is Stark. Let's have a conversation! Also, if you want to exit any time, just type Bye!
You: Hello
BOT: Hi there
You: What is AI?
BOT: Artificial Intelligence refers to...
You: Bye
BOT: Goodbye! Take care <3
